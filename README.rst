.. warning::
    The pysisso package has been archived. There was not much attraction from users anymore and no time to maintain. Also the new SISSO++ package, reimplemented in C++ and with python
    bindings is likely to be more efficient and used. More information here: https://sissopp_developers.gitlab.io/sissopp/#

    If you still have a need and would like support from us to revive the pysisso package, don't hesitate to contact us at info@matgenix.com.
