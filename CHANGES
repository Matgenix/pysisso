  - Removed setup.py and setup.cfg
  - Installation with poetry using "poetry install" command
  - Distribution package (including setup.py generated automatically by poetry) using
    the "poetry build" command
  - See https://python-poetry.org/

  - bandit
  - flake8
  - black
  - isort

* Full test suite (unit and integration tests)

  - Based on pytest (see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
  - Using pytest-cov (using coverage, https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.3/)
    to get code coverage reports (see https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - Using pytest-mock (using unittest.mock,
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) for mocking SISSO execution
    in unit tests (see https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/)
